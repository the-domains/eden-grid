EDEN ACOUSTICS PRESENTS A NEW VISION OF THE HIGH-END LOUDSPEAKER 

The TOMEI AIR is not merely a loudspeaker but a precisely tuned active loudspeaker system that incorporates 32 bits / 384 Khz digital crossovers (DSP), a DAC for each frequency band, and individual new generation class D amplifiers to power each driver. Our design is called Open Air Design and brings the concept of open baffle to its extreme limits. No box. Not even a baffle in sight! What is left is music so alive that for the first time you not only listen to a LIVE performance, you attend it! 

Along with high quality balanced and unbalanced analog and digital S/PDIF inputs, the speakers offer a USB Audio Class 2 input (32 bits /384 Khz). It means you can connect your computer directly to the TOMEI control unit and play HD music. No need for a DAC and preamp. Add a Google Chromecast Audio module and you can wirelessly send music to the speakers with your intelligent phone or tablet. The TOMEI AIr becomes the center of your musical and cinematic adventures!
